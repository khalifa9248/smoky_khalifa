When I opened my eyes again I found myself in a 1830 Victorian Era setting bedroom. A tall man towered over me. His appearance alone was seductive. The man's rugged features were alluring. His raven black hair, which glisten in the moonlight illuminating from the window, was combed back and his face carefully structured. As if God had molded him just to spoil these eyes. The cold blue eyes of the man were full of intensity. He had a Roman nose and a thin pair of lips that was in a form of a smirk. His tight jaw was an angular shape that was filled with little stubbles. His pale skin looked so...right. The man had on a white cotton shirt with a silky blue vest and a pair of black pants, which tied everything together.
